Experimental attempt at getting rid of hideous gray and black borders everywhere
while still retaining visual separation between elements.

I like to think this makes 10 things look better for every 1 it doesn't...

Forces consistent, white spacing with specific elements. Note: this has no effect
if border-style was none. Used 3px to maintain visual separation. Used white to 
convert all hideous gray borders into far less hideous white spacing. White has an
added benefit of making nested borders not look so awful as they blend with each
other and the background.

    against the body tag's white background.)
