# Transform localizations from TranslateWiki.net
#
# As of late 2020, TranslateWiki creates PRs automatically, in line with
# how they work with other repos. However, the strings still need to be
# translated to work well with the iOS app. This script runs when a new PR
# is created by TranslateWiki, to add everything the app needs to the PR.
